# Konami code example

This example uses [`useSequentialState`](../../doc/useSequentialState) to implement a hook that looks for
the [Konami code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code) key sequence.

## Seeing the code in action

Go to the `examples/payment` folder. Run `npm install` then `npm start`. A browser window should automatically
open up.
